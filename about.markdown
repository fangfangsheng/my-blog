Hi there! I'm Fangfang, a graduate student at Northeastern University majoring in Bioinformatics with a concentration in Machine Learning and Visualization. I have gained valuable experience through my schoolwork and various internships. Next up, I will be graduating and earning my Master's degree in April 2021!

I value data-driven success and prioritize delivering insights and communication with scientists and engineers. I am currently working at NIBR Informatics as an AI and Machine Learning intern. Working closely with neuroscientists and data scientists across departments, I have applied Machine Learning methods to Rodent EEG data to assess how drugs impact the activity and function of the brain. To accomplish this, I developed an end to end machine learning pipeline to increase the efficiency of hypothesis testing and validation.

From 2017 to 2018, I worked as an ERP consultant at Inspur corporation. I specialized in providing data solutions to Fortune 500 companies across industries. I collaborated with engineers, product managers, and support experience teams to devise solutions.

As an engineer, I am passionate about using state-of-art technologies to tackle real-world challenges. I am interested in working for a company where I can apply my unique skillset to build innovative products that will benefit both the company and the community.
