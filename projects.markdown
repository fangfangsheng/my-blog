<ins>Novartis EEG lab</ins>   **Automatic high throughput genotype classification pipeline with feature selection based on Rodents EEG Signals**

EEG(Electroencephalogram) analysis has been an important and widely use tool in neuroscience with applications. It can determine changes in brain activity that server as one useful decision-making tool in diagnosing brain disorders and monitoring the drug effect. Some efforts are already being done on using human clinical EEG data to differentiate groups. However, EEG signals in combination with machine learning (ML) approaches were not commonly used for the Rodent genotype prediction.

Current approach in EEG lab is using pre-defined frequency bins, determine which are contributing most to group differences by manually looking at Prism plots.
We needed approach can identify new phenotypes without pre-defined bins. Look across whole EEG spectral domain to identify more robust meta-phenotypes to enhance EEGs effectiveness as a translatable biomarker.

To accomplish this, I developed an end to end machine learning pipeline to increase the efficiency of hypothesis testing and validation during my CoOp at Novartis.

<ins>MITHack-Medicine 2020</ins>   **COVIData Registry**

As the impact of COVID-19 on hospital systems and health care workforces continues, how can we best help hospitals quickly shift human resources, redeploy healthcare workers appropriately based on skills sets, and quickly train current/new healthcare workers to fill certain needs of the health system while protecting the physical and mental well-being of our healthcare workforce?

Within 72 hours, we proposed and finished the system Design of a *curated COVID-19 registry database* of patient-level data from US hospitals that can be accessed by researchers to answer
questions about the best treatment options for patients with specific characteristics (e.g., age, sex, pre-existing conditions).
