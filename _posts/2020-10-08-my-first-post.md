Welcome to my first post! Nice to meet you here.

I finished the [Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) class at Coursera on October 2017. I started to code since then. Although I am currently enrolled in a graduate program to start a career in programming, I found I teached myself computer science for the most of time.... I have spent all day long looking for one tiny bug and googling for answers. There’s many different coding resources and frameworks out there. It is could be helpful and stressful. Some solutions work for others but not for me. I know a lot of time it is just a small trival difference but the process is just painful and exhausted.   

This is the moment I really hope everyone are good recorders. For a long time, I have been wanting to write down the problems and solutions I have met along the way, I was always intimidated by the complex contents and long writing.

Folloing several excellent data scientists/computer scientists' blogs, I’ve learned that I can put my daily learning into perspective and just be content at improving a little bit each day. I would like to give a shot and here are things I will be writing about

*  A few things I’ve built 
*  A few bugs I've solved 
* A few things I am building
