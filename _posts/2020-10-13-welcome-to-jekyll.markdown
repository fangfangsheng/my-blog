Youâ€™ll find this blog is build on top of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

If you are looking for build a *static* presentation websites, like personal blog and professional portfolio, meanwhile you are intended to focus on the contents rather than building everything from scratch, then Jekyll and Github Pages could be the things you want to take a look at first. This combination of tech stack is !reliable, easy to use, and maintain.

One of the most important advantages of using Jekyll and Github Pages is the abundant resources you can find online. Not only the step by step [instructions](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages), but the tons of successful and beautiful [examples](https://jekyllrb.com/showcase/) make it is easy to start with. 

There is no need to reinvent the wheels. The above instructions are very informactive. Just one thing happened to me while I was installed the Jekyll.  After the installation of Jekyll has done, I typed `jekyll` in my terminal. However,
~~~bash
$ jekyll
~~~

Gives an error:
~~~bash
-bash: jekyll: command not found
~~~
